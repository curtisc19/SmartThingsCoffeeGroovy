# SmartThingsCoffeeGroovy
SmartThings app to start my coffee! Hook into a routine and bam! Create a virtual switch...checks if water is in the coffee maker (via water sensor) and turns on the virtual switch which turns on the power outlet to coffee maker and sends a push notification that coffee has started brewing. If no water, then sends a push notification saying no water in coffee maker and does not turn on the virtual switch / power outlet.
