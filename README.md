# SmartThingsCoffeeGroovy
SmartThings app to start my coffee! Hooked into a routine, checks if water is in the coffee maker (via water sensor) and turns on power outlet to coffee maker and sends a push notification that coffee has started brewing. If no water, then sends a push notification saying no water in coffee maker.
